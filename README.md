# Reverse-Image-Search-Engine

This project uses transfer learning to find similar images. In simple words, the process entails passing the images through a pretrained convolutional neural network like ResNet-50,extracting the features, and then using a metric to calculate the error rate like the Euclidean distance.

Learning objectives:
1. Perform feature extraction and similarity search on Caltech101 and Caltech256 datasets
2. Learn how to scale to large datasets
3. Make the system more accurate and optimized
4. Analyze case studies to see how these concepts are used in mainstream products.
